# `comlink-everywhere`

This is a workaround to help patch inconsistent environments until module workers (and eventually [module block](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-js-module-blocks) workers) are available everywhere. Module workers are:

- Available in Chromium-based browers, `node` (with an API significantly differing from all other environments), and [`deno`](https://deno.land/manual/runtime/workers).
- [Implemented in Safari](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164860), but probably not available on iOS until iOS 15.
- [In progress](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247687) for Firefox

It also helps test bundler compat issues like [snowpackjs/snowpack#3476](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/issues/3476)

## Usage

```js
// index.js
import { workerFileConstructor, wrap } from "comlink-everywhere/outside";

(async () => {
  const Worker = await workerFileConstructor();
  const api = wrap(
    new Worker(new URL("./worker.js", import.meta.url), { type: "module" })
  );
  console.log(await api.add(3, 4));
})();
```

```js
// worker.js
import { expose } from "comlink-everywhere/inside";

expose({
  add: (x, y) => x + y,
});
```

### Construct from string

```js
import { constructWorkerFromString } from "comlink-everywhere/outside";

(async () => {
  const worker = await constructWorkerFromString(
    // Note: this example only works in browsers.
    `self.postMessage("from worker");`
  );
  worker.addEventListener("message", (message) => console.log(message.data));
})();
```

For maximum compatibility in the short term, the best option is to compile the worker into a source string that does not use any imports, and does not use any syntax or functions specific to CommonJS (e.g. `require()`), ESM (e.g. `import`), or the web (e.g. `importScripts()`)

## Tradeoffs

- If you're running `node` , the `type` option will be ignored and the worker will be instantiated as a classic/module worker matching the calling code. See <https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/30682>
- This library is written as ESM. It is only meant to be used with ESM, except specifically for workers instantiated from strings (as a workaround for Firefox and Safari's lack of module worker support).
- The `Worker` constructor cannot be retrieved synchronously.
  - The implementation uses a dynamic import to get the `node` constructor for better compatibility (by not importing `node` modules unless necessary), which means it is not available synchronously.
- `.terminate()` is not currently available on `node` workers. Please file an issue if you want to use this library and be able to call `.terminate()`.
  - Note that we always call [`.unref()`](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html#worker_threads_broadcastchannel_unref) for `node` workers, which means they will not hold up program exit.
